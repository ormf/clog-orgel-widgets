* clog-dsp-widgets

This project facilitates creating dsp guis in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]], by
providing sliders, toggles, numboxes, vu-meters, etc., very similar to
the widgets found in programs like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider][SuperCollider]] or
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)][Max/MSP]].

The widgets are primarily aimed at providing elements for control
surfaces to interact with with dsp related realtime software like
[[https://incudine.sourceforge.net][Incudine]], [[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], etc. from Common Lisp, either
directly or by using network protocols like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control][OSC]].

As the surfaces are running on a webbrowser, installation and usage
requires minimum effort and tehy are usable from a large variety of
devices like mobile phones, tablets, laptops etc. The project depends
on [[https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog][CLOG]] by David Botton, which does the heavy lifting to handle the
connection between Common Lisp and Javascript/CSS/Html5.
