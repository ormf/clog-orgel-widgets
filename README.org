*** Orm Finnendahl <orm.finnendahl@selma.hfmdk-frankfurt.de>

This is a project for creating widgets to use for dsp guis in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common
Lisp]], very similar to the widgets found in programs like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]],
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider][SuperCollider]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)][Max/MSP]].

The widgets are primarily aimed at providing a gui interface for dsp
in Common Lisp (to interact with with [[https://incudine.sourceforge.net][Incudine]], [[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], etc.)
