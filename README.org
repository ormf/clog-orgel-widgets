* clog-dsp-widgets

This project facilitates creating dsp guis in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]], very
similar to the widgets found in programs like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider][SuperCollider]]
or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)][Max/MSP]].

The widgets are primarily aimed at providing control surfaces to
interact with with dsp related realtime software like [[https://incudine.sourceforge.net][Incudine]],
[[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], etc. controlled within Common Lisp, either
directly or by using network protocols like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control][OSC]]. As the surfaces are
running on a webbrowser installation and usage requires minimum effort
and is usable from a large variety of devices like mobile phones,
tablets, laptops etc.
